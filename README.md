# Spring Boot Applications Testing Practices

In this repository, I delved into the essential elements of testing Spring Boot applications to enhance the production readiness of my applications. I explored various key topics, such as unit testing, conducting comprehensive application testing through the use of the @SpringBootTest annotation, mastering the art of crafting efficient unit tests with JUnit, and harnessing the power of Spring Boot testing slices to isolate and simplify the testing process.

### *Note*

I also used planefinder and aircraft positions as base projects to write the tests on them. Different versions for different uses like reactive programming, Spring Data exploration, and Spring MVC can be found in my repositories.
